# PYBER ANALYSIS
## **Overview of the Analysis**
After a detailed analysis for PyBer, CEO requested to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type . Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, CEO requested to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type i.e Rural, Suburban, and Urban.

## **Results**
### **DataFrame Summary**

By merging two data sets, the fare per ride and fare per driver averages were calculated resulting in the summary DataFrame by city type.
1. The Rural city type have the lowest number of total drivers due to which it impacted on average fare per driver which is the highest in all city types.

2. The Urban type have more drivers than total rides, which have a huge impact on the average fare per ride and average fare per driver. The Urban drivers have the lowest average fare per ride in all city types

### **Total fare by City Type**
1. The Rural city type increases in mid of February and declined in early March. and then increased again in month of April.

2. In the same way the Suburban city type increases in mid of February and declined in early March and then starts to peak again at the end of April, while the Rural city type falls down.

3. For the Urban city type,peak starts from February which lasts through April, while the other city types drops down in the month of March.

## **Summary**
1. Reduce number of drivers in urban cities. There are 2405 drivers which made  1625 rides. That means not every driver has done at least one ride and because of which average fare per reduced dramatically. Reducing number of drivers will increase average fare per driver

2. PyBer should work on collecting mileage distance data as part of the data collection process and analysis to get more detailed results 

3. The rural cities are making  profit while the  Urban cities are making higher revenue, . So, improving urban cities rides are recommended.
